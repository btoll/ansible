## Notes

This role has only been tested on Ubuntu Bionic 18.04. The [default version of PHP](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/php/php) is 7.2, so that is hardcoded.  There are currently no plans to support other platforms or versions.

To download the roles:

```
ansible-galaxy install --role-file=requirements.yml --roles-path=roles/
```
